            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet.

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "35 Buddhas\nThe Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are known from the Sutra of the Three, popular in Tibetan Buddhism. This\nMahayana Sutra describes the practice of purification by confession and making prostrations to these Buddhas,\nand is part of the larger Stack of Jewels Sutra.\n\nIn Tibet, there were two distinct traditions of the Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas which arose from the two main\nIndian schools of Mahayana Buddhism: one from the Madhyamaka school founded by Nagarjuna, and the other from the\nYogacara school founded by Asanga and Vasubandhu. Both of these schools developed their rituals for conferring\nthe Bodhisattva vows, each incorporating a visualization of the Thirty-Five Buddhas along with the recitation of\nthe confession from the Triskhandhadharma Sutra.\n\nThe Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are a common subject depicted in Himalayan Buddhist paintings and sculptures.\nThere are at least three different iconographic systems for depicting the Thirty-Five Buddhas, based on the\ndifferent descriptions found in ritual texts and commentaries by different authors including Nagarjuna, Sakya\nPandita, Jonang Taranatha, and Je Tsongkhapa.\nThe three main iconographic traditions are:\n\nThe system attributed to Nagarjuna where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with different objects in their hands,\n\nThe system of Sakya Pandita where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with hand gestures only (no hand objects), and\n\nThe system is based on Je Tsongkhapa's vision of the 35 Buddhas where only some of the Buddhas have objects in\ntheir hands.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

He is also portrayed standing. As a Bodhisattva he dresses as royalty; as a Buddha,\nhe dresses as a monk. He is said to reside in the Tushita heaven, which is part of the Deva Realm of the\nKamadhatu (Desire Realm, which is the world depicted in the Bhavachakra).\n\nIn China, Maitreya is identified as the “Laughing Buddha”, Pu-Tai, who is the fat, jolly portrayal of Buddha\nthat emerged from 10th-century Chinese folklore.\nThere are different representations of Maitreya with different poses and gestures.\nIn the Thangka painting, Maitreya is seated above a throne in the most common position with the legs extended\nand both feet on the ground. His skin is yellow-gold color and his two hands are placed in front of his heart\nperforming the dharma teaching Mudra.\n\nHe holds the stems of two Utpala (blue lotus) flowers blossoming and supporting on the right a water flask and\non the left a dharma wheel.\n\nMaitreya has adorned with several jewels: a crown, earrings, necklaces, bracelets and he wears silk scarves and\ncolorful robes with gold decors.",

            "liquid": "Maitreya Buddha\nMaitreya is a transcendent Bodhisattva named the universal Buddha of a future time. The name is taken from the\nSanskrit Maitri (in Pali, Metta), which means “loving-kindness”. In Mahayana Buddhism, Maitreya is the\nembodiment of all-encompassing love.\n\nMaitreya is depicted in Buddhist art in many ways. “Classical” portrayals often show him seated, as in a chair,\nwith his feet on the ground. He is also portrayed standing. As a Bodhisattva he dresses as royalty; as a Buddha,\nhe dresses as a monk. He is said to reside in the Tushita heaven, which is part of the Deva Realm of the\nKamadhatu (Desire Realm, which is the world depicted in the Bhavachakra).\n\nIn China, Maitreya is identified as the “Laughing Buddha”, Pu-Tai, who is the fat, jolly portrayal of Buddha\nthat emerged from 10th-century Chinese folklore.\nThere are different representations of Maitreya with different poses and gestures.\nIn the Thangka painting, Maitreya is seated above a throne in the most common position with the legs extended\nand both feet on the ground. His skin is yellow-gold color and his two hands are placed in front of his heart\nperforming the dharma teaching Mudra.\n\nHe holds the stems of two Utpala (blue lotus) flowers blossoming and supporting on the right a water flask and\non the left a dharma wheel.\n\nMaitreya has adorned with several jewels: a crown, earrings, necklaces, bracelets and he wears silk scarves and\ncolorful robes with gold decors.",

            "liquid": "Chakrasamvara\nChakrasamvara is also known as Samvara, a potent form of Heruka, which is one of the principals Yidam meditation\ndeities of the Sarma schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Samvara is most often depicted with a blue-colored body, four\nfaces, and twelve arms.\n\nIn western translations of meditation texts Samvara’s name is often translated as “Highest Bliss”. Meditation on\nChakrasamvara is an advanced meditation practice that is transmitted by one’s lama and effectively binds the\nmind of the meditator to the state of enlightenment. As a result, these types of meditations should not be\nentered into lightly, and it is strongly advised that such advanced Tantric meditations be conducted with the\nguidance of an authentic lama, meaning one who is clearly within the lineage.\n\nThe archetypal nature of Chakrasamvara empowers us to use our inherent enlightened ability to simultaneously\noperate both within the worlds of Samsara (illusion) and nirvana (absolute truth and bliss). This capacity\nallows us to be of greater service to other sentient beings since we gain greater insight into the circumstances\nof Samsara and thus know how to deal with difficult situations more effectively.",

He is also portrayed standing. As a Bodhisattva he dresses as royalty; as a Buddha,\nhe dresses as a monk. He is said to reside in the Tushita heaven, which is part of the Deva Realm of the\nKamadhatu (Desire Realm, which is the world depicted in the Bhavachakra).\n\nIn China, Maitreya is identified as the “Laughing Buddha”, Pu-Tai, who is the fat, jolly portrayal of Buddha\nthat emerged from 10th-century Chinese folklore.\nThere are different representations of Maitreya with different poses and gestures.\nIn the Thangka painting, Maitreya is seated above a throne in the most common position with the legs extended\nand both feet on the ground. His skin is yellow-gold color and his two hands are placed in front of his heart\nperforming the dharma teaching Mudra.\n\nHe holds the stems of two Utpala (blue lotus) flowers blossoming and supporting on the right a water flask and\non the left a dharma wheel.\n\nMaitreya has adorned with several jewels: a crown, earrings, necklaces, bracelets and he wears silk scarves and\ncolorful robes with gold decors.",

He took the name of Dharmakara Bodhisattva and\nafter accumulating great merit over countless lives, finally achieved enlightenment and became a Buddha.\nBuddha Amitabha now reigns over “Sukhavati”, the western paradise also called “The Pure Land”.\nAmitabha has red skin and is dressed in monk's robes sitting in a lotus position. His hands are folded and\nfacing up in meditation Mudra (Samadhi) holding a bowl containing the nectar of immortality.\n\nAmitayus is the emanation of Amitabha and he is depicted with fine clothes, jewels, and a five-pointed crown.\n\nAmitabha is the symbol of comprehensive love, longevity, and wisdom.

So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet.

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

She is considered by some to be the original Tara and is the female consort of Amoghasiddhi, one of\nthe “self-born” Buddhas. She is generally shown seated on a lotus throne with her right leg hanging down,\nwearing the ornaments of a Bodhisattva and holding the closed blue lotus (Utpala).\n\n“Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha”, is an ancient mantra that is related to Tara, the “Mother of all Buddhas”, and\nespecially to her manifestation as Green Tara. Green Tara mantra is one of the three main mantras Tibetan monks\nand lamas recite upon praying. By reciting the mantra, one is said to be able to invoke the blessings of Tara\nand request her protection.\n\nGreen Tara is adorned in silken garments and jeweled ornaments. The main difference in the iconography between\nthe Green Tara and the White Tara is the position of the legs. Green Tara sits in a posture of ease, with one\nleg drawn towards her and the other resting on a lotus bud that springs from the pedestal. Her hands are in the\nMudra of perfect generosity, holding the stems of blue lotus showing a peaceful and smiling expression.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

This\nMahayana Sutra describes the practice of purification by confession and making prostrations to these Buddhas,\nand is part of the larger Stack of Jewels Sutra.\n\nIn Tibet, there were two distinct traditions of the Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas which arose from the two main\nIndian schools of Mahayana Buddhism: one from the Madhyamaka school founded by Nagarjuna, and the other from the\nYogacara school founded by Asanga and Vasubandhu. Both of these schools developed their rituals for conferring\nthe Bodhisattva vows, each incorporating a visualization of the Thirty-Five Buddhas along with the recitation of\nthe confession from the Triskhandhadharma Sutra.\n\nThe Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are a common subject depicted in Himalayan Buddhist paintings and sculptures.\nThere are at least three different iconographic systems for depicting the Thirty-Five Buddhas, based on the\ndifferent descriptions found in ritual texts and commentaries by different authors including Nagarjuna, Sakya\nPandita, Jonang Taranatha, and Je Tsongkhapa.\nThe three main iconographic traditions are:\n\nThe system attributed to Nagarjuna where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with different objects in their hands,\n\nThe system of Sakya Pandita where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with hand gestures only (no hand objects), and\n\nThe system is based on Je Tsongkhapa's vision of the 35 Buddhas where only some of the Buddhas have objects in\ntheir hands.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

She is considered by some to be the original Tara and is the female consort of Amoghasiddhi, one of\nthe “self-born” Buddhas. She is generally shown seated on a lotus throne with her right leg hanging down,\nwearing the ornaments of a Bodhisattva and holding the closed blue lotus (Utpala).\n\n“Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha”, is an ancient mantra that is related to Tara, the “Mother of all Buddhas”, and\nespecially to her manifestation as Green Tara. Green Tara mantra is one of the three main mantras Tibetan monks\nand lamas recite upon praying. By reciting the mantra, one is said to be able to invoke the blessings of Tara\nand request her protection.\n\nGreen Tara is adorned in silken garments and jeweled ornaments. The main difference in the iconography between\nthe Green Tara and the White Tara is the position of the legs. Green Tara sits in a posture of ease, with one\nleg drawn towards her and the other resting on a lotus bud that springs from the pedestal. Her hands are in the\nMudra of perfect generosity, holding the stems of blue lotus showing a peaceful and smiling expression.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

This\nMahayana Sutra describes the practice of purification by confession and making prostrations to these Buddhas,\nand is part of the larger Stack of Jewels Sutra.\n\nIn Tibet, there were two distinct traditions of the Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas which arose from the two main\nIndian schools of Mahayana Buddhism: one from the Madhyamaka school founded by Nagarjuna, and the other from the\nYogacara school founded by Asanga and Vasubandhu. Both of these schools developed their rituals for conferring\nthe Bodhisattva vows, each incorporating a visualization of the Thirty-Five Buddhas along with the recitation of\nthe confession from the Triskhandhadharma Sutra.\n\nThe Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are a common subject depicted in Himalayan Buddhist paintings and sculptures.\nThere are at least three different iconographic systems for depicting the Thirty-Five Buddhas, based on the\ndifferent descriptions found in ritual texts and commentaries by different authors including Nagarjuna, Sakya\nPandita, Jonang Taranatha, and Je Tsongkhapa.\nThe three main iconographic traditions are:\n\nThe system attributed to Nagarjuna where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with different objects in their hands,\n\nThe system of Sakya Pandita where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with hand gestures only (no hand objects), and\n\nThe system is based on Je Tsongkhapa's vision of the 35 Buddhas where only some of the Buddhas have objects in\ntheir hands.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

He assumed this manifestation at Paro Thaksang in Bhutan to bring the local deities and\nguardians under his control. The meaning of his name: Dorje is the Tibetan word for Vajra, which can be\ntranslated as “indestructible”. Drolo means “ultimately”, or “insanely wrathful”, and is sometimes translated as\n“crazy wisdom”. So, the name of the eighth emanation of Guru Padmasambhava is “Indestructible Crazy Wisdom”.\n\nDorje Drolo is also a very special and powerful emanation to help clear away and dispel complex webs of mental\nand emotional obstacles. Dorje Drolo is the best practice for removing mental and emotional obstacles. Guru\nRinpoche appeared in this form to liberate sentient beings from anger and attachment.\n\nPeople who feel mentally unstable or unhappy for no apparent reason would benefit from practicing on Dorje\nDrolo.

And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

By reciting the mantra, one is said to be able to invoke the blessings of Tara\nand request her protection.\n\nGreen Tara is adorned in silken garments and jeweled ornaments. The main difference in the iconography between\nthe Green Tara and the White Tara is the position of the legs. Green Tara sits in a posture of ease, with one\nleg drawn towards her and the other resting on a lotus bud that springs from the pedestal. Her hands are in the\nMudra of perfect generosity, holding the stems of blue lotus showing a peaceful and smiling expression.",

So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

She is generally shown seated on a lotus throne with her right leg hanging down,\nwearing the ornaments of a Bodhisattva and holding the closed blue lotus (Utpala).\n\n“Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha”, is an ancient mantra that is related to Tara, the “Mother of all Buddhas”, and\nespecially to her manifestation as Green Tara. Green Tara mantra is one of the three main mantras Tibetan monks\nand lamas recite upon praying. By reciting the mantra, one is said to be able to invoke the blessings of Tara\nand request her protection.\n\nGreen Tara is adorned in silken garments and jeweled ornaments. The main difference in the iconography between\nthe Green Tara and the White Tara is the position of the legs. Green Tara sits in a posture of ease, with one\nleg drawn towards her and the other resting on a lotus bud that springs from the pedestal. Her hands are in the\nMudra of perfect generosity, holding the stems of blue lotus showing a peaceful and smiling expression.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections.

She is generally shown seated on a lotus throne with her right leg hanging down,\nwearing the ornaments of a Bodhisattva and holding the closed blue lotus (Utpala).\n\n“Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha”, is an ancient mantra that is related to Tara, the “Mother of all Buddhas”, and\nespecially to her manifestation as Green Tara. Green Tara mantra is one of the three main mantras Tibetan monks\nand lamas recite upon praying. By reciting the mantra, one is said to be able to invoke the blessings of Tara\nand request her protection.\n\nGreen Tara is adorned in silken garments and jeweled ornaments. The main difference in the iconography between\nthe Green Tara and the White Tara is the position of the legs. Green Tara sits in a posture of ease, with one\nleg drawn towards her and the other resting on a lotus bud that springs from the pedestal. Her hands are in the\nMudra of perfect generosity, holding the stems of blue lotus showing a peaceful and smiling expression.",

So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

            "liquid": "Chenrezig aka Avalokitesvara aka Avalokiteshvara\nChenrezig, also known as Avalokitesvara, “One who looks with an unwavering eye” is the most revered of all\nBodhisattva, embodying the compassion of all Buddhas. He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

Often these\nmantras are associated with particular Buddhist figures, whose qualities can be cultivated by the repetition of\nthe relevant mantra.\nMantras and Mandalas are two sides of one coin. Mantras are sacred texts and mandalas are sacred pictures.\nWithout mantras, the mandala looks incomplete.

            "liquid": "Kalachakra Mandala\nKalachakra is a Sanskrit word that means “Wheel of Time”. The concept of the wheel of time is a metaphor to\ndescribe the process of transformation from ordinary and material existence to enlightenment.\n\nKalachakra tradition contains teachings on cosmology, theology, philosophy, sociology, soteriology, myth,\nprophecy, medicine, and yoga. It depicts a mythic reality whereby cosmic and socio-historical events correspond\nto processes in the bodies of individuals. These teachings are meant to lead to a transformation of one's body\nand mind into perfect Buddhahood through various yogic methods.\n\nThe symbolism of the Kalachakra Mandala is rich. It is a two-dimensional depiction of the three-dimensional\npalace of the deity Kalachakra. At the top of the palace, or the center of the mandala dwells the god himself.\nArrayed around the halls of the five-story palace beneath his feet are 722 other deities, all submitting to the\ngreat god Kalachakra who symbolizes the unstoppable passage of time.\nThe floors of the palace depicted in the Kalachakra Mandala, from the ground up, represent:\nEnlightened Body\nEnlightened Speech\nEnlightened Mind\nEnlightened Wisdom\nEnlightened Great Bliss\nArrayed around the palace are four elemental rings and two outer rings. From the inside out they are:\nEarth\nWater\nFire\nWind\nSpace\nWisdom\nTaken together, all of these elements compose a microcosm of the universe, ruled by time personified.",

The concept of the wheel of time is a metaphor to\ndescribe the process of transformation from ordinary and material existence to enlightenment.\n\nKalachakra tradition contains teachings on cosmology, theology, philosophy, sociology, soteriology, myth,\nprophecy, medicine, and yoga. It depicts a mythic reality whereby cosmic and socio-historical events correspond\nto processes in the bodies of individuals. These teachings are meant to lead to a transformation of one's body\nand mind into perfect Buddhahood through various yogic methods.\n\nThe symbolism of the Kalachakra Mandala is rich. It is a two-dimensional depiction of the three-dimensional\npalace of the deity Kalachakra. At the top of the palace, or the center of the mandala dwells the god himself.\nArrayed around the halls of the five-story palace beneath his feet are 722 other deities, all submitting to the\ngreat god Kalachakra who symbolizes the unstoppable passage of time.\nThe floors of the palace depicted in the Kalachakra Mandala, from the ground up, represent:\nEnlightened Body\nEnlightened Speech\nEnlightened Mind\nEnlightened Wisdom\nEnlightened Great Bliss\nArrayed around the palace are four elemental rings and two outer rings. From the inside out they are:\nEarth\nWater\nFire\nWind\nSpace\nWisdom\nTaken together, all of these elements compose a microcosm of the universe, ruled by time personified.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

            "liquid": "Chenrezig aka Avalokitesvara aka Avalokiteshvara\nChenrezig, also known as Avalokitesvara, “One who looks with an unwavering eye” is the most revered of all\nBodhisattva, embodying the compassion of all Buddhas. He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

To Buddhists, existence is a cycle of life, death, rebirth, and suffering that\nthey seek to escape altogether.\n\nThe Wheel is divided into five or six realms, or states, into which a soul can be reborn. It is held by a demon.\nAround the rim are depicted the twelve stages of dependent origination. The rich iconography of the Wheel of\nLife can be interpreted on several levels. The six major sections represent the Six Realms. These realms can be\nunderstood as forms of existence, or states of mind, into which beings are born according to their karma. The\nrealms also can be viewed as situations in life or even personality types - hungry ghosts are addicts; Devas are\nprivileged well-being's have anger issues.\nRealms\nIn each of the realms, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara appears to show the way to liberation from the Wheel. But\nliberation is possible only in the human realm. From there, those who realize enlightenment find their way out\nof the Wheel to Nirvana.\n\nThe Wheel of Life is one of the most common subjects of Buddhist art. The detailed symbolism of the Wheel can be\ninterpreted on many levels.\n\nThe Wheel of Life (called the Bhavachakra in Sanskrit) represents the cycle of birth and rebirth and existence\nin Samsara.\n\nMany Buddhists understand the Wheel in an allegorical, not literal, way. As you examine the parts of the wheel\nyou might find yourself relating to some of it personally or recognizing people you know as Jealous Gods or Hell\nBeings or Hungry Ghosts.\n\nThe outer circle of the Wheel is the Paticca Samuppada, the Links of Dependent Origination. Traditionally, the\nouter wheel depicts a:\n\nBlind man or woman (representing ignorance)\nPotters (formation)\nA monkey (consciousness)\nTwo men in a boat (mind and body)\nA house with six windows (the senses)\nAn embracing couple (contact)\nAn eye pierced by an arrow (sensation)\nA person drinking (thirst)\nA man gathering fruit (grasping)\nA couple making love (becoming)\nA woman giving birth (birth)",

So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

She is considered by some to be the original Tara and is the female consort of Amoghasiddhi, one of\nthe “self-born” Buddhas. She is generally shown seated on a lotus throne with her right leg hanging down,\nwearing the ornaments of a Bodhisattva and holding the closed blue lotus (Utpala).\n\n“Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha”, is an ancient mantra that is related to Tara, the “Mother of all Buddhas”, and\nespecially to her manifestation as Green Tara. Green Tara mantra is one of the three main mantras Tibetan monks\nand lamas recite upon praying. By reciting the mantra, one is said to be able to invoke the blessings of Tara\nand request her protection.\n\nGreen Tara is adorned in silken garments and jeweled ornaments. The main difference in the iconography between\nthe Green Tara and the White Tara is the position of the legs. Green Tara sits in a posture of ease, with one\nleg drawn towards her and the other resting on a lotus bud that springs from the pedestal. Her hands are in the\nMudra of perfect generosity, holding the stems of blue lotus showing a peaceful and smiling expression.",

            "liquid": "Kalachakra Mandala\nKalachakra is a Sanskrit word that means “Wheel of Time”. The concept of the wheel of time is a metaphor to\ndescribe the process of transformation from ordinary and material existence to enlightenment.\n\nKalachakra tradition contains teachings on cosmology, theology, philosophy, sociology, soteriology, myth,\nprophecy, medicine, and yoga. It depicts a mythic reality whereby cosmic and socio-historical events correspond\nto processes in the bodies of individuals. These teachings are meant to lead to a transformation of one's body\nand mind into perfect Buddhahood through various yogic methods.\n\nThe symbolism of the Kalachakra Mandala is rich. It is a two-dimensional depiction of the three-dimensional\npalace of the deity Kalachakra. At the top of the palace, or the center of the mandala dwells the god himself.\nArrayed around the halls of the five-story palace beneath his feet are 722 other deities, all submitting to the\ngreat god Kalachakra who symbolizes the unstoppable passage of time.\nThe floors of the palace depicted in the Kalachakra Mandala, from the ground up, represent:\nEnlightened Body\nEnlightened Speech\nEnlightened Mind\nEnlightened Wisdom\nEnlightened Great Bliss\nArrayed around the palace are four elemental rings and two outer rings. From the inside out they are:\nEarth\nWater\nFire\nWind\nSpace\nWisdom\nTaken together, all of these elements compose a microcosm of the universe, ruled by time personified.",

Traditionally, the\nouter wheel depicts a:\n\nBlind man or woman (representing ignorance)\nPotters (formation)\nA monkey (consciousness)\nTwo men in a boat (mind and body)\nA house with six windows (the senses)\nAn embracing couple (contact)\nAn eye pierced by an arrow (sensation)\nA person drinking (thirst)\nA man gathering fruit (grasping)\nA couple making love (becoming)\nA woman giving birth (birth)",

She is considered by some to be the original Tara and is the female consort of Amoghasiddhi, one of\nthe “self-born” Buddhas. She is generally shown seated on a lotus throne with her right leg hanging down,\nwearing the ornaments of a Bodhisattva and holding the closed blue lotus (Utpala).\n\n“Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha”, is an ancient mantra that is related to Tara, the “Mother of all Buddhas”, and\nespecially to her manifestation as Green Tara. Green Tara mantra is one of the three main mantras Tibetan monks\nand lamas recite upon praying. By reciting the mantra, one is said to be able to invoke the blessings of Tara\nand request her protection.\n\nGreen Tara is adorned in silken garments and jeweled ornaments. The main difference in the iconography between\nthe Green Tara and the White Tara is the position of the legs. Green Tara sits in a posture of ease, with one\nleg drawn towards her and the other resting on a lotus bud that springs from the pedestal. Her hands are in the\nMudra of perfect generosity, holding the stems of blue lotus showing a peaceful and smiling expression.",

Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world.

Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures.

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "35 Buddhas\nThe Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are known from the Sutra of the Three, popular in Tibetan Buddhism. This\nMahayana Sutra describes the practice of purification by confession and making prostrations to these Buddhas,\nand is part of the larger Stack of Jewels Sutra.\n\nIn Tibet, there were two distinct traditions of the Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas which arose from the two main\nIndian schools of Mahayana Buddhism: one from the Madhyamaka school founded by Nagarjuna, and the other from the\nYogacara school founded by Asanga and Vasubandhu. Both of these schools developed their rituals for conferring\nthe Bodhisattva vows, each incorporating a visualization of the Thirty-Five Buddhas along with the recitation of\nthe confession from the Triskhandhadharma Sutra.\n\nThe Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are a common subject depicted in Himalayan Buddhist paintings and sculptures.\nThere are at least three different iconographic systems for depicting the Thirty-Five Buddhas, based on the\ndifferent descriptions found in ritual texts and commentaries by different authors including Nagarjuna, Sakya\nPandita, Jonang Taranatha, and Je Tsongkhapa.\nThe three main iconographic traditions are:\n\nThe system attributed to Nagarjuna where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with different objects in their hands,\n\nThe system of Sakya Pandita where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with hand gestures only (no hand objects), and\n\nThe system is based on Je Tsongkhapa's vision of the 35 Buddhas where only some of the Buddhas have objects in\ntheir hands.",

So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits.

Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

The concept of the wheel of time is a metaphor to\ndescribe the process of transformation from ordinary and material existence to enlightenment.\n\nKalachakra tradition contains teachings on cosmology, theology, philosophy, sociology, soteriology, myth,\nprophecy, medicine, and yoga. It depicts a mythic reality whereby cosmic and socio-historical events correspond\nto processes in the bodies of individuals. These teachings are meant to lead to a transformation of one's body\nand mind into perfect Buddhahood through various yogic methods.\n\nThe symbolism of the Kalachakra Mandala is rich. It is a two-dimensional depiction of the three-dimensional\npalace of the deity Kalachakra. At the top of the palace, or the center of the mandala dwells the god himself.\nArrayed around the halls of the five-story palace beneath his feet are 722 other deities, all submitting to the\ngreat god Kalachakra who symbolizes the unstoppable passage of time.\nThe floors of the palace depicted in the Kalachakra Mandala, from the ground up, represent:\nEnlightened Body\nEnlightened Speech\nEnlightened Mind\nEnlightened Wisdom\nEnlightened Great Bliss\nArrayed around the palace are four elemental rings and two outer rings. From the inside out they are:\nEarth\nWater\nFire\nWind\nSpace\nWisdom\nTaken together, all of these elements compose a microcosm of the universe, ruled by time personified.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

Samvara is most often depicted with a blue-colored body, four\nfaces, and twelve arms.\n\nIn western translations of meditation texts Samvara’s name is often translated as “Highest Bliss”. Meditation on\nChakrasamvara is an advanced meditation practice that is transmitted by one’s lama and effectively binds the\nmind of the meditator to the state of enlightenment. As a result, these types of meditations should not be\nentered into lightly, and it is strongly advised that such advanced Tantric meditations be conducted with the\nguidance of an authentic lama, meaning one who is clearly within the lineage.\n\nThe archetypal nature of Chakrasamvara empowers us to use our inherent enlightened ability to simultaneously\noperate both within the worlds of Samsara (illusion) and nirvana (absolute truth and bliss). This capacity\nallows us to be of greater service to other sentient beings since we gain greater insight into the circumstances\nof Samsara and thus know how to deal with difficult situations more effectively.",

In Mahayana Buddhism, Maitreya is the\nembodiment of all-encompassing love.\n\nMaitreya is depicted in Buddhist art in many ways. “Classical” portrayals often show him seated, as in a chair,\nwith his feet on the ground. He is also portrayed standing. As a Bodhisattva he dresses as royalty; as a Buddha,\nhe dresses as a monk. He is said to reside in the Tushita heaven, which is part of the Deva Realm of the\nKamadhatu (Desire Realm, which is the world depicted in the Bhavachakra).\n\nIn China, Maitreya is identified as the “Laughing Buddha”, Pu-Tai, who is the fat, jolly portrayal of Buddha\nthat emerged from 10th-century Chinese folklore.\nThere are different representations of Maitreya with different poses and gestures.\nIn the Thangka painting, Maitreya is seated above a throne in the most common position with the legs extended\nand both feet on the ground. His skin is yellow-gold color and his two hands are placed in front of his heart\nperforming the dharma teaching Mudra.\n\nHe holds the stems of two Utpala (blue lotus) flowers blossoming and supporting on the right a water flask and\non the left a dharma wheel.\n\nMaitreya has adorned with several jewels: a crown, earrings, necklaces, bracelets and he wears silk scarves and\ncolorful robes with gold decors.",

            "liquid": "Wheel Of Life aka Riduk\nThe Bhavachakra, the Wheel of Life or Wheel of Becoming, is a Thangka with a complex picture representing the\nBuddhist view of the universe. To Buddhists, existence is a cycle of life, death, rebirth, and suffering that\nthey seek to escape altogether.\n\nThe Wheel is divided into five or six realms, or states, into which a soul can be reborn. It is held by a demon.\nAround the rim are depicted the twelve stages of dependent origination. The rich iconography of the Wheel of\nLife can be interpreted on several levels. The six major sections represent the Six Realms. These realms can be\nunderstood as forms of existence, or states of mind, into which beings are born according to their karma. The\nrealms also can be viewed as situations in life or even personality types - hungry ghosts are addicts; Devas are\nprivileged well-being's have anger issues.\nRealms\nIn each of the realms, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara appears to show the way to liberation from the Wheel. But\nliberation is possible only in the human realm. From there, those who realize enlightenment find their way out\nof the Wheel to Nirvana.\n\nThe Wheel of Life is one of the most common subjects of Buddhist art. The detailed symbolism of the Wheel can be\ninterpreted on many levels.\n\nThe Wheel of Life (called the Bhavachakra in Sanskrit) represents the cycle of birth and rebirth and existence\nin Samsara.\n\nMany Buddhists understand the Wheel in an allegorical, not literal, way. As you examine the parts of the wheel\nyou might find yourself relating to some of it personally or recognizing people you know as Jealous Gods or Hell\nBeings or Hungry Ghosts.\n\nThe outer circle of the Wheel is the Paticca Samuppada, the Links of Dependent Origination. Traditionally, the\nouter wheel depicts a:\n\nBlind man or woman (representing ignorance)\nPotters (formation)\nA monkey (consciousness)\nTwo men in a boat (mind and body)\nA house with six windows (the senses)\nAn embracing couple (contact)\nAn eye pierced by an arrow (sensation)\nA person drinking (thirst)\nA man gathering fruit (grasping)\nA couple making love (becoming)\nA woman giving birth (birth)",

He took the name of Dharmakara Bodhisattva and\nafter accumulating great merit over countless lives, finally achieved enlightenment and became a Buddha.\nBuddha Amitabha now reigns over “Sukhavati”, the western paradise also called “The Pure Land”.\nAmitabha has red skin and is dressed in monk's robes sitting in a lotus position. His hands are folded and\nfacing up in meditation Mudra (Samadhi) holding a bowl containing the nectar of immortality.\n\nAmitayus is the emanation of Amitabha and he is depicted with fine clothes, jewels, and a five-pointed crown.\n\nAmitabha is the symbol of comprehensive love, longevity, and wisdom. He is associated with the third “Skandha”\nof perception and the technique of visualization of the surrounding world as a paradise.

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPadmasambhava aka Guru Rinpoche\nPadmasambhava, also called Guru Rinpoche, Tibetan: Slob-Dpon (“Teacher”), or Padma Byung-Gnas (“Lotus-Born”),\nBuddhist mystic who introduced Tantric Buddhism to Tibet and who is credited with establishing the first\nBuddhist monastery there.\n\nPadmasambhava is often depicted in his more traditional representation seated in royal posture holding a Vajra\nin his right hand while his left hand holds a skull-cup containing a vase filled with the nectar of longevity\nand wisdom.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

            "liquid": "Wheel Of Life aka Riduk\nThe Bhavachakra, the Wheel of Life or Wheel of Becoming, is a Thangka with a complex picture representing the\nBuddhist view of the universe. To Buddhists, existence is a cycle of life, death, rebirth, and suffering that\nthey seek to escape altogether.\n\nThe Wheel is divided into five or six realms, or states, into which a soul can be reborn. It is held by a demon.\nAround the rim are depicted the twelve stages of dependent origination. The rich iconography of the Wheel of\nLife can be interpreted on several levels. The six major sections represent the Six Realms. These realms can be\nunderstood as forms of existence, or states of mind, into which beings are born according to their karma. The\nrealms also can be viewed as situations in life or even personality types - hungry ghosts are addicts; Devas are\nprivileged well-being's have anger issues.\nRealms\nIn each of the realms, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara appears to show the way to liberation from the Wheel. But\nliberation is possible only in the human realm. From there, those who realize enlightenment find their way out\nof the Wheel to Nirvana.\n\nThe Wheel of Life is one of the most common subjects of Buddhist art. The detailed symbolism of the Wheel can be\ninterpreted on many levels.\n\nThe Wheel of Life (called the Bhavachakra in Sanskrit) represents the cycle of birth and rebirth and existence\nin Samsara.\n\nMany Buddhists understand the Wheel in an allegorical, not literal, way. As you examine the parts of the wheel\nyou might find yourself relating to some of it personally or recognizing people you know as Jealous Gods or Hell\nBeings or Hungry Ghosts.\n\nThe outer circle of the Wheel is the Paticca Samuppada, the Links of Dependent Origination. Traditionally, the\nouter wheel depicts a:\n\nBlind man or woman (representing ignorance)\nPotters (formation)\nA monkey (consciousness)\nTwo men in a boat (mind and body)\nA house with six windows (the senses)\nAn embracing couple (contact)\nAn eye pierced by an arrow (sensation)\nA person drinking (thirst)\nA man gathering fruit (grasping)\nA couple making love (becoming)\nA woman giving birth (birth)",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago.

Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world.

Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

The pose represents the\nmystical union of the active force, or method (Upaya, conceived of as masculine), with wisdom (Prajna, conceived\nof as feminine) in a fusion necessary to overcome the false duality of separation between people.\n\nIt is believed that during the primordial time, the Yab Yum Buddha saw that the mind was often fooled into\nbelieving there was a distinction between “I” and “you”. Thus, He sought to liberate his mind from this false\ndistinction. Similar to the Yin Yang symbol in China, it shows that two seeming distinctions exist as one,\ndependent on one another.",

The concept of the wheel of time is a metaphor to\ndescribe the process of transformation from ordinary and material existence to enlightenment.\n\nKalachakra tradition contains teachings on cosmology, theology, philosophy, sociology, soteriology, myth,\nprophecy, medicine, and yoga. It depicts a mythic reality whereby cosmic and socio-historical events correspond\nto processes in the bodies of individuals. These teachings are meant to lead to a transformation of one's body\nand mind into perfect Buddhahood through various yogic methods.\n\nThe symbolism of the Kalachakra Mandala is rich. It is a two-dimensional depiction of the three-dimensional\npalace of the deity Kalachakra. At the top of the palace, or the center of the mandala dwells the god himself.\nArrayed around the halls of the five-story palace beneath his feet are 722 other deities, all submitting to the\ngreat god Kalachakra who symbolizes the unstoppable passage of time.\nThe floors of the palace depicted in the Kalachakra Mandala, from the ground up, represent:\nEnlightened Body\nEnlightened Speech\nEnlightened Mind\nEnlightened Wisdom\nEnlightened Great Bliss\nArrayed around the palace are four elemental rings and two outer rings. From the inside out they are:\nEarth\nWater\nFire\nWind\nSpace\nWisdom\nTaken together, all of these elements compose a microcosm of the universe, ruled by time personified.",

The pose represents the\nmystical union of the active force, or method (Upaya, conceived of as masculine), with wisdom (Prajna, conceived\nof as feminine) in a fusion necessary to overcome the false duality of separation between people.\n\nIt is believed that during the primordial time, the Yab Yum Buddha saw that the mind was often fooled into\nbelieving there was a distinction between “I” and “you”. Thus, He sought to liberate his mind from this false\ndistinction. Similar to the Yin Yang symbol in China, it shows that two seeming distinctions exist as one,\ndependent on one another.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

At the top of the palace, or the center of the mandala dwells the god himself.\nArrayed around the halls of the five-story palace beneath his feet are 722 other deities, all submitting to the\ngreat god Kalachakra who symbolizes the unstoppable passage of time.\nThe floors of the palace depicted in the Kalachakra Mandala, from the ground up, represent:\nEnlightened Body\nEnlightened Speech\nEnlightened Mind\nEnlightened Wisdom\nEnlightened Great Bliss\nArrayed around the palace are four elemental rings and two outer rings.

She is called Vajravarahi in Tantric Buddhism, or Vajrayana, a tradition in\nwhich she is considered the supreme deity - more revered than any male Buddha.\n\nVajrayogini is the goddess of grace and destruction, destroying illusion and the ego. She is typically depicted\nin fierce form, colored blood red. She wears a necklace of skulls and holds a skull cup and flaying knife in her\nhands. Surrounding her are cremation grounds. Symbolically, the necklace skulls represent the letters of the\nSanskrit alphabet and purification of speech. The knife severs worldly attachments, while she pours bliss from\nthe cup to devotees.\n\nVajrayogini's yoga Tantra practice is believed to be a faster path to enlightenment. Traditionally, both mantras\nand practices of Vajrayogini are secret, even though many mantras are now widely available on the internet and\nin books. Traditionalists warn that only a qualified teacher can provide proper guidance for the use of these\nmantras.",

Kalachakra has twenty-four hands, eight white, eight red, and eight blacks.\n\nAlthough many of these appear violent, they symbolize the overcoming of violence through compassion and wisdom.\nThe Tantras and commentaries discuss the implements in great detail, for each implement contains great symbolic\nmeaning; the Vajra-Cleaver, for example, symbolizes; in part the wisdom that cuts through one’s habitually\nself-centered attitudes and egoism.\n\nThe Kalachakra Tantra was introduced into Tibet in the tenth century, it is perhaps the most influential Tantric\npractice in Vajrayana Buddhism.",

            "liquid": "Wheel Of Life aka Riduk\nThe Bhavachakra, the Wheel of Life or Wheel of Becoming, is a Thangka with a complex picture representing the\nBuddhist view of the universe. To Buddhists, existence is a cycle of life, death, rebirth, and suffering that\nthey seek to escape altogether.\n\nThe Wheel is divided into five or six realms, or states, into which a soul can be reborn. It is held by a demon.\nAround the rim are depicted the twelve stages of dependent origination. The rich iconography of the Wheel of\nLife can be interpreted on several levels. The six major sections represent the Six Realms. These realms can be\nunderstood as forms of existence, or states of mind, into which beings are born according to their karma. The\nrealms also can be viewed as situations in life or even personality types - hungry ghosts are addicts; Devas are\nprivileged well-being's have anger issues.\nRealms\nIn each of the realms, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara appears to show the way to liberation from the Wheel. But\nliberation is possible only in the human realm. From there, those who realize enlightenment find their way out\nof the Wheel to Nirvana.\n\nThe Wheel of Life is one of the most common subjects of Buddhist art. The detailed symbolism of the Wheel can be\ninterpreted on many levels.\n\nThe Wheel of Life (called the Bhavachakra in Sanskrit) represents the cycle of birth and rebirth and existence\nin Samsara.\n\nMany Buddhists understand the Wheel in an allegorical, not literal, way. As you examine the parts of the wheel\nyou might find yourself relating to some of it personally or recognizing people you know as Jealous Gods or Hell\nBeings or Hungry Ghosts.\n\nThe outer circle of the Wheel is the Paticca Samuppada, the Links of Dependent Origination. Traditionally, the\nouter wheel depicts a:\n\nBlind man or woman (representing ignorance)\nPotters (formation)\nA monkey (consciousness)\nTwo men in a boat (mind and body)\nA house with six windows (the senses)\nAn embracing couple (contact)\nAn eye pierced by an arrow (sensation)\nA person drinking (thirst)\nA man gathering fruit (grasping)\nA couple making love (becoming)\nA woman giving birth (birth)",

This\nMahayana Sutra describes the practice of purification by confession and making prostrations to these Buddhas,\nand is part of the larger Stack of Jewels Sutra.\n\nIn Tibet, there were two distinct traditions of the Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas which arose from the two main\nIndian schools of Mahayana Buddhism: one from the Madhyamaka school founded by Nagarjuna, and the other from the\nYogacara school founded by Asanga and Vasubandhu. Both of these schools developed their rituals for conferring\nthe Bodhisattva vows, each incorporating a visualization of the Thirty-Five Buddhas along with the recitation of\nthe confession from the Triskhandhadharma Sutra.\n\nThe Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are a common subject depicted in Himalayan Buddhist paintings and sculptures.\nThere are at least three different iconographic systems for depicting the Thirty-Five Buddhas, based on the\ndifferent descriptions found in ritual texts and commentaries by different authors including Nagarjuna, Sakya\nPandita, Jonang Taranatha, and Je Tsongkhapa.\nThe three main iconographic traditions are:\n\nThe system attributed to Nagarjuna where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with different objects in their hands,\n\nThe system of Sakya Pandita where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with hand gestures only (no hand objects), and\n\nThe system is based on Je Tsongkhapa's vision of the 35 Buddhas where only some of the Buddhas have objects in\ntheir hands.",

So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

Since all the colors get dissolved into black color, all the names and\nforms melt into the deity as well. This symbolizes the embracing and encompassing nature of the deity. The color\nblack also represents the absolute or ultimate reality and the nature of Mahakala.\nIn Sanskrit, this principle is also known as “Nirguna”, which means beyond all quality and form.\nIt gets depicted in various forms with five skull crowns. This symbolizes the transmutation of five negative\nafflictions into the five wisdom. The depiction of the number of arms in the deity varies in various cultures\namong other details.",

He is holding a Vajra (Tibetan: Dorje) in his\nright hand and a lasso in his left.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet.

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "Wheel Of Life aka Riduk\nThe Bhavachakra, the Wheel of Life or Wheel of Becoming, is a Thangka with a complex picture representing the\nBuddhist view of the universe. To Buddhists, existence is a cycle of life, death, rebirth, and suffering that\nthey seek to escape altogether.\n\nThe Wheel is divided into five or six realms, or states, into which a soul can be reborn. It is held by a demon.\nAround the rim are depicted the twelve stages of dependent origination. The rich iconography of the Wheel of\nLife can be interpreted on several levels. The six major sections represent the Six Realms. These realms can be\nunderstood as forms of existence, or states of mind, into which beings are born according to their karma. The\nrealms also can be viewed as situations in life or even personality types - hungry ghosts are addicts; Devas are\nprivileged well-being's have anger issues.\nRealms\nIn each of the realms, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara appears to show the way to liberation from the Wheel. But\nliberation is possible only in the human realm. From there, those who realize enlightenment find their way out\nof the Wheel to Nirvana.\n\nThe Wheel of Life is one of the most common subjects of Buddhist art.

            "liquid": "35 Buddhas\nThe Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are known from the Sutra of the Three, popular in Tibetan Buddhism. This\nMahayana Sutra describes the practice of purification by confession and making prostrations to these Buddhas,\nand is part of the larger Stack of Jewels Sutra.\n\nIn Tibet, there were two distinct traditions of the Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas which arose from the two main\nIndian schools of Mahayana Buddhism: one from the Madhyamaka school founded by Nagarjuna, and the other from the\nYogacara school founded by Asanga and Vasubandhu. Both of these schools developed their rituals for conferring\nthe Bodhisattva vows, each incorporating a visualization of the Thirty-Five Buddhas along with the recitation of\nthe confession from the Triskhandhadharma Sutra.\n\nThe Thirty-Five Confession Buddhas are a common subject depicted in Himalayan Buddhist paintings and sculptures.\nThere are at least three different iconographic systems for depicting the Thirty-Five Buddhas, based on the\ndifferent descriptions found in ritual texts and commentaries by different authors including Nagarjuna, Sakya\nPandita, Jonang Taranatha, and Je Tsongkhapa.\nThe three main iconographic traditions are:\n\nThe system attributed to Nagarjuna where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with different objects in their hands,\n\nThe system of Sakya Pandita where the 35 Buddhas are depicted with hand gestures only (no hand objects), and\n\nThe system is based on Je Tsongkhapa's vision of the 35 Buddhas where only some of the Buddhas have objects in\ntheir hands.",

It depicts a mythic reality whereby cosmic and socio-historical events correspond\nto processes in the bodies of individuals. These teachings are meant to lead to a transformation of one's body\nand mind into perfect Buddhahood through various yogic methods.\n\nThe symbolism of the Kalachakra Mandala is rich. It is a two-dimensional depiction of the three-dimensional\npalace of the deity Kalachakra. At the top of the palace, or the center of the mandala dwells the god himself.\nArrayed around the halls of the five-story palace beneath his feet are 722 other deities, all submitting to the\ngreat god Kalachakra who symbolizes the unstoppable passage of time.\nThe floors of the palace depicted in the Kalachakra Mandala, from the ground up, represent:\nEnlightened Body\nEnlightened Speech\nEnlightened Mind\nEnlightened Wisdom\nEnlightened Great Bliss\nArrayed around the palace are four elemental rings and two outer rings. From the inside out they are:\nEarth\nWater\nFire\nWind\nSpace\nWisdom\nTaken together, all of these elements compose a microcosm of the universe, ruled by time personified.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

He assumed this manifestation at Paro Thaksang in Bhutan to bring the local deities and\nguardians under his control. The meaning of his name: Dorje is the Tibetan word for Vajra, which can be\ntranslated as “indestructible”. Drolo means “ultimately”, or “insanely wrathful”, and is sometimes translated as\n“crazy wisdom”. So, the name of the eighth emanation of Guru Padmasambhava is “Indestructible Crazy Wisdom”.\n\nDorje Drolo is also a very special and powerful emanation to help clear away and dispel complex webs of mental\nand emotional obstacles. Dorje Drolo is the best practice for removing mental and emotional obstacles. Guru\nRinpoche appeared in this form to liberate sentient beings from anger and attachment.\n\nPeople who feel mentally unstable or unhappy for no apparent reason would benefit from practicing on Dorje\nDrolo. Even though everything is fine, sometimes the mind still doesn’t feel comfortable, relaxed, or at peace.\nWe feel unsettled. This is when practicing on Dorje Drolo is especially relevant and useful. It will help calm\nand balance the mind.",

            "liquid": "Buddha Life Story\nThe painting shows the different phases of Shakyamuni Buddha’s life. Buddha’s life painting is based on the\n“Twelve Great Deeds of Buddha”.\nHistory of Gautama Buddha\nAccording to the documents written down more than two hundred years after Buddha’s death, his mother, Maya Devi,\nan Indian queen, daydreamed that she would become pregnant from a white elephant touching her right side with\nits trunk.\n\nIn Indian mythology, elephants are seen as strong and fertile beings. And white is seen as a sign of purity and\nimmaculacy.\nThe Birth of Buddha\nAccording to the legend, Queen Maya was pregnant for 10 months. When she was aware that her time was near, she\nfollowed an old custom and went on a journey to her parent's home in Nepal.\n\nHowever, before reaching her parents’ home, she gave birth to her son in a garden in Lumbini, in today’s Nepal.\nQueen Maya grabbed the branch of a tree and Buddha was born by coming out of her right side, the way he was\nconceived. Queen Maya Devi died seven days later. There have been discussions among scholars if the historical\nbirth of Buddha may have been by cesarean section.\nLife at Court\nGautama Siddhartha grew up behind high court walls, well protected from the ugliness of the real world of\naverage people. He could have enjoyed the luxurious life of a rich prince. But he was not happy.\n\nTo distract him his father wanted the prince to marry. A tournament was organized as a test for who was the\nstrongest and best marriage candidate for Princess Gopi. In one contest, Buddha’s rivals killed a white\nelephant. However, Buddha, repelled by the senseless killing, tossed the elephant over the palace wall and\nbrought it back to life.\nPrince Siddhartha Encounters Suffering\nOne day the prince left the palace and realized what real life was. He saw poverty, illness, the fate of aging\nand he saw a burial of a deceased person. Buddha recognized that there was suffering outside the luxury of the\npalace.\nPrince Siddhartha Leaves the Palace Forever\nPrince Siddhartha, in the meantime 29 years old, married and father of one son, decided to leave the palace to\nfind an answer to why there is suffering in the world and how to free the world from it. Secretly at night he\nleft the palace on horseback and accompanied by a servant. Once he was far away from the palace, he sent the\nservant with the horseback. Buddha took the seat in front of a Stupa and cut his long hair off and dressed like\na monk to begin the life of a simple student under different guru teachers.\nAsceticism and Meditation\nFor six years the Buddha practiced asceticism under different guru masters. But after six years he and his\nfriends who accompanied him were close to death due to extreme asceticism. But Buddha recognized that this did\nnot take him anywhere closer to understanding the mechanisms of this world.\n\nAfter 6 years of fruitless asceticism, the Buddha decided to eat again. This is what Buddhists call the “middle\nway”, avoiding extremes to both sides. Buddha began to meditate under a large tree.\nBuddha’s Enlightenment\nAfter several weeks of meditation Buddha finally found enlightenment by understanding the causes of suffering\nand how to end suffering.\nMara’s Attack\nThis was the right moment for Demon Mara to enter the stage. Mara is a kind of incarnation of the evil, the\ndevil so to say. Mara does not want Buddha to find enlightenment and does his best to prevent it. He sends evil\nmonsters who shoot with arrows at the Buddha. But the arrows turn into flowers. Finally, he sends his beautiful\ndaughters to seduce the Buddha. But the beautiful young ladies turn into old, ugly women.\nTeachings\nAfter having found enlightenment, the Buddha spent the rest of his life traveling in Nepal, Northern India, and\nteaching his findings and principles.\nNirvana\nAt the age of roughly 80 years, the historical Buddha passed away. As he had reached the state of enlightenment,\nhe passed into nirvana. For Buddhists, nirvana is the final bliss, the end of the cycle of rebirths and the end\nof all suffering.\nBuddha Life\nIn the center of all Buddha Life Thangkas, one finds always the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. He is shown with a\nbeggar’s bowl in his left hand and with his right hand calling the earth as the witness, a scene from the story\nof Mara’s attack.\n\nThe details of a Buddha Life Thangka may vary and even the different scenes may not always be found in the same\nplace. But the basic pattern is always the same.",

Often these\nmantras are associated with particular Buddhist figures, whose qualities can be cultivated by the repetition of\nthe relevant mantra.\nMantras and Mandalas are two sides of one coin. Mantras are sacred texts and mandalas are sacred pictures.\nWithout mantras, the mandala looks incomplete. Mantra helps mandalas to be more meaningful and mandala helps us\nto be focused.\n\nStandard descriptions of mandalas and mantras show a relationship between their use and pagan gods or\nsupernatural cosmic forces.\nMantra Mandala is meditative which is useful in meditation.",

Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world.

Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures.

            "liquid": "Green Tara\nThe Green Tara (Sanskrit: Shyamatara; Tibetan: Sgrol-Ijang) was believed to be incarnated as the Nepali\nprincess. She is considered by some to be the original Tara and is the female consort of Amoghasiddhi, one of\nthe “self-born” Buddhas. She is generally shown seated on a lotus throne with her right leg hanging down,\nwearing the ornaments of a Bodhisattva and holding the closed blue lotus (Utpala).\n\n“Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha”, is an ancient mantra that is related to Tara, the “Mother of all Buddhas”, and\nespecially to her manifestation as Green Tara. Green Tara mantra is one of the three main mantras Tibetan monks\nand lamas recite upon praying. By reciting the mantra, one is said to be able to invoke the blessings of Tara\nand request her protection.\n\nGreen Tara is adorned in silken garments and jeweled ornaments. The main difference in the iconography between\nthe Green Tara and the White Tara is the position of the legs. Green Tara sits in a posture of ease, with one\nleg drawn towards her and the other resting on a lotus bud that springs from the pedestal. Her hands are in the\nMudra of perfect generosity, holding the stems of blue lotus showing a peaceful and smiling expression.",

Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures.

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

In Vajrayana Buddhism, the principle of purity and purification.\nVajrasattva embodies the capacity to eliminate spiritual impurities of all kinds, particularly neglected\ncommitments toward one’s teacher and one’s spiritual development.\n\nVajrasattva is a Sambhogakaya manifestation; he unifies all the five Buddha families within himself in the same\nway that the white color of his body unifies all the five colors.\nWith his right hand, he holds a Vajra to his heart, which signifies his indestructible essence.\nHis left hand holds a bell, rests on his hip; this is an expression of his compassion.\nThe hundred syllable mantra associated with him is used in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism for purification of\nthe mind.",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

She is generally shown seated on a lotus throne with her right leg hanging down,\nwearing the ornaments of a Bodhisattva and holding the closed blue lotus (Utpala).\n\n“Om Tare Tuttare Ture Soha”, is an ancient mantra that is related to Tara, the “Mother of all Buddhas”, and\nespecially to her manifestation as Green Tara. Green Tara mantra is one of the three main mantras Tibetan monks\nand lamas recite upon praying. By reciting the mantra, one is said to be able to invoke the blessings of Tara\nand request her protection.\n\nGreen Tara is adorned in silken garments and jeweled ornaments. The main difference in the iconography between\nthe Green Tara and the White Tara is the position of the legs. Green Tara sits in a posture of ease, with one\nleg drawn towards her and the other resting on a lotus bud that springs from the pedestal. Her hands are in the\nMudra of perfect generosity, holding the stems of blue lotus showing a peaceful and smiling expression.",

            "liquid": "Wheel Of Life aka Riduk\nThe Bhavachakra, the Wheel of Life or Wheel of Becoming, is a Thangka with a complex picture representing the\nBuddhist view of the universe. To Buddhists, existence is a cycle of life, death, rebirth, and suffering that\nthey seek to escape altogether.\n\nThe Wheel is divided into five or six realms, or states, into which a soul can be reborn. It is held by a demon.\nAround the rim are depicted the twelve stages of dependent origination. The rich iconography of the Wheel of\nLife can be interpreted on several levels. The six major sections represent the Six Realms. These realms can be\nunderstood as forms of existence, or states of mind, into which beings are born according to their karma. The\nrealms also can be viewed as situations in life or even personality types - hungry ghosts are addicts; Devas are\nprivileged well-being's have anger issues.\nRealms\nIn each of the realms, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara appears to show the way to liberation from the Wheel. But\nliberation is possible only in the human realm. From there, those who realize enlightenment find their way out\nof the Wheel to Nirvana.\n\nThe Wheel of Life is one of the most common subjects of Buddhist art. The detailed symbolism of the Wheel can be\ninterpreted on many levels.\n\nThe Wheel of Life (called the Bhavachakra in Sanskrit) represents the cycle of birth and rebirth and existence\nin Samsara.\n\nMany Buddhists understand the Wheel in an allegorical, not literal, way. As you examine the parts of the wheel\nyou might find yourself relating to some of it personally or recognizing people you know as Jealous Gods or Hell\nBeings or Hungry Ghosts.\n\nThe outer circle of the Wheel is the Paticca Samuppada, the Links of Dependent Origination. Traditionally, the\nouter wheel depicts a:\n\nBlind man or woman (representing ignorance)\nPotters (formation)\nA monkey (consciousness)\nTwo men in a boat (mind and body)\nA house with six windows (the senses)\nAn embracing couple (contact)\nAn eye pierced by an arrow (sensation)\nA person drinking (thirst)\nA man gathering fruit (grasping)\nA couple making love (becoming)\nA woman giving birth (birth)",

            "liquid": "Shakyamuni Buddha\nShakyamuni Buddha is a name given to the historical Buddha, especially in Mahayana Buddhism. So, it's nearly\nalways the case that when someone is talking about Shakyamuni, he or she is speaking of the historical figure\nwho was born Siddhartha Gautama but then became known as Shakyamuni only after he became the Buddha. This\nperson, after his enlightenment, is also sometimes called Gautama Buddha.\n\nHowever, people also speak of Shakyamuni as a more transcendent figure who still is, and not as a historical\nfigure who lived a long time ago. Especially if you are new to Buddhism, this may be confusing. Let's take a\nlook at Shakyamuni Buddha and his role in Buddhism.\n\nThere are hundreds of reproductions of these motifs all over the world. Yet, almost every single representation\nwill have a certain number of identical traits. These are what allow us to recognize the different Buddhas and\nthe qualities that they possess.\n\nPainted in shades of gold or beige and wearing monastic robes, he is seated atop a lotus throne on which are\nsymbolically placed the sun and moon.\n\nHis lotus seat symbolizes the act of living in this world without being soiled by its imperfections. The sun\nrepresents “Prajna” or wisdom. The moon represents “Upaya” or the willful means of compassion.\n\nThe left hand is in the Dhyani or meditation Mudra. Whilst the right hand is in the Bhumisparsa Mudra translated\nin English to “taking the earth as a witness” which refers to a particular episode of the Buddha’s Life, a\nThangka detailing his life story.\nDisciples\nHe is often painted with his two disciples, Sariputra famous for his wisdom and Maudgalyayana for his miraculous\nfeats. Both disciples are believed to have been Brahmins who studied the Vedas before being initiated into\nBuddhism.\nBuddha's Throne\nThe Buddha is often, but not always, represented on a throne supported by two lions. Just as lions are thought\nto be the kings of the animals, Buddha too is a king amongst the divine. We can sometimes see an extravagant\nbackrest, containing 6 mystical creatures. This refers to the six Paramitas or the six perfections, the\nprincipal qualities required to attain Buddhahood.",

            "liquid": "Wheel Of Life aka Riduk\nThe Bhavachakra, the Wheel of Life or Wheel of Becoming, is a Thangka with a complex picture representing the\nBuddhist view of the universe. To Buddhists, existence is a cycle of life, death, rebirth, and suffering that\nthey seek to escape altogether.\n\nThe Wheel is divided into five or six realms, or states, into which a soul can be reborn. It is held by a demon.\nAround the rim are depicted the twelve stages of dependent origination. The rich iconography of the Wheel of\nLife can be interpreted on several levels. The six major sections represent the Six Realms. These realms can be\nunderstood as forms of existence, or states of mind, into which beings are born according to their karma. The\nrealms also can be viewed as situations in life or even personality types - hungry ghosts are addicts; Devas are\nprivileged well-being's have anger issues.\nRealms\nIn each of the realms, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara appears to show the way to liberation from the Wheel. But\nliberation is possible only in the human realm. From there, those who realize enlightenment find their way out\nof the Wheel to Nirvana.\n\nThe Wheel of Life is one of the most common subjects of Buddhist art. The detailed symbolism of the Wheel can be\ninterpreted on many levels.\n\nThe Wheel of Life (called the Bhavachakra in Sanskrit) represents the cycle of birth and rebirth and existence\nin Samsara.\n\nMany Buddhists understand the Wheel in an allegorical, not literal, way. As you examine the parts of the wheel\nyou might find yourself relating to some of it personally or recognizing people you know as Jealous Gods or Hell\nBeings or Hungry Ghosts.\n\nThe outer circle of the Wheel is the Paticca Samuppada, the Links of Dependent Origination. Traditionally, the\nouter wheel depicts a:\n\nBlind man or woman (representing ignorance)\nPotters (formation)\nA monkey (consciousness)\nTwo men in a boat (mind and body)\nA house with six windows (the senses)\nAn embracing couple (contact)\nAn eye pierced by an arrow (sensation)\nA person drinking (thirst)\nA man gathering fruit (grasping)\nA couple making love (becoming)\nA woman giving birth (birth)",

He listens to the prayers of all sentient beings in times\nof challenge and difficulty.\n\nIn one prominent Buddhist story, Chenrezig vows never to rest until he has helped free all sentient beings from\nSamsara, but despite his best efforts, his task is overwhelming. So, in his effort to reach out to so many cries\nof suffering, his arms are shattered into pieces, making them many, to better reach out to those in need.\n\nSometimes Chenrezig visualized with eleven heads and a thousand arms fanned out around him. Tibetan Buddhism\nrelates Chenrezig to the six-syllable mantra, Om Mani Padme Hum, and when this mantra is spoken aloud or in\nsilence, it invokes his benevolent power and intervention.\n\nChenrezig is considered the patron of Tibet. And, in fact, the living Buddha, the Dalai Lama, is an incarnation\nof him.\nIn China, Chenrezig is often depicted in a female form and he is known as Kuan Yin or Guanyin.",

The concept of the wheel of time is a metaphor to\ndescribe the process of transformation from ordinary and material existence to enlightenment.\n\nKalachakra tradition contains teachings on cosmology, theology, philosophy, sociology, soteriology, myth,\nprophecy, medicine, and yoga. It depicts a mythic reality whereby cosmic and socio-historical events correspond\nto processes in the bodies of individuals. These teachings are meant to lead to a transformation of one's body\nand mind into perfect Buddhahood through various yogic methods.\n\nThe symbolism of the Kalachakra Mandala is rich. It is a two-dimensional depiction of the three-dimensional\npalace of the deity Kalachakra. At the top of the palace, or the center of the mandala dwells the god himself.\nArrayed around the halls of the five-story palace beneath his feet are 722 other deities, all submitting to the\ngreat god Kalachakra who symbolizes the unstoppable passage of time.\nThe floors of the palace depicted in the Kalachakra Mandala, from the ground up, represent:\nEnlightened Body\nEnlightened Speech\nEnlightened Mind\nEnlightened Wisdom\nEnlightened Great Bliss\nArrayed around the palace are four elemental rings and two outer rings. From the inside out they are:\nEarth\nWater\nFire\nWind\nSpace\nWisdom\nTaken together, all of these elements compose a microcosm of the universe, ruled by time personified.",
